# Particle Simulator

This is a small project I'm working on for fun. I realise Python is not the optimal language for this kind of thing, but it does allow quick development. The main goal here is to have fun creating something and learning something doing it.


## Installation

If you have `virtualenv 16.*`, you can just use `setup.sh` to install the app.
Otherwise, the dependencies are:
* Python 3.7
* `pyglet`


## Execution
The program can be executed using the `run.sh` script, or using the command
`python3 Particles.py`
